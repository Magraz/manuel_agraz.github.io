PiBOT is a platform for mobile robot research that I designed and developed during my last year of Bachelor's. I developed the mechanical design, electrical diagrams and component selection, as well as the software of the robot.

The techonologies I used during my work with the robot are the following:

- ROS 1 Melodic
- VueJS
- Python
- C
- Java.
- Fusion 360

The robot's capabilities are the following:

- Face detection
- Fingerprint reading
- Tele-operation
- Payment terminal integration
