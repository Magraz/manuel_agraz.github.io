Roomie IT Hospitaliy Robot is a robot I worked on during my time at Roomie IT. I worked on the software and design of the robot's UI as well as the integration of the robot's hardware and the UI. I also worked in developing the software that integrates the ultrasonic, and oxymeter sensor's with robot's software.

The techonologies I used during my work with the robot are the following:

- ROS 1 Melodic
- ReactJS
- Python
- C
- Amazon Web Services: Lex, Rekognition, DynamoDB, Lambda, SES.

The robot's capabilities are the following:

- Face recognition
- Temperature measurement
- Autonomous navigation
- Oxygen level measurement
- Voice interaction
- Payment terminal integration
